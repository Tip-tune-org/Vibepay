## Overview

VibePay implements WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards, ensuring:

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Screen readers can navigate and understand content
- Color contrast meets minimum ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Animations respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Forms have proper labels and error associations

## Keyboard Navigation

### Global Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `?` | Open keyboard shortcuts help |
| `Tab` | Navigate to next element |
| `Shift + Tab` | Navigate to previous element |
| `Escape` | Close modals |

### Player Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play/Pause |
| `←` | Previous track |
| `→` | Next track |
| `↑` | Increase volume |
| `↓` | Decrease volume |
| `M` | Mute/Unmute |

### Focus Management

- **Skip Link**: Press `Tab` on page load to access "Skip to main content" link
- **Focus Trap**: Modals trap focus within the dialog
- **Focus Restoration**: Focus returns to trigger element when modals close
- **Visible Focus**: All interactive elements show visible focus indicators

## Screen Reader Support

### ARIA Live Regions

The app uses ARIA live regions to announce dynamic content changes:

- **Polite announcements**: Track changes, volume adjustments
- **Assertive announcements**: Critical errors, important state changes

### Semantic HTML

- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Landmark regions (`main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`)
- Lists use semantic `<ul>` and `<li>` elements
- Forms use proper `<label>` associations

### ARIA Attributes Used

- `aria-label`: Provides accessible names for icon buttons
- `aria-labelledby`: References visible labels
- `aria-describedby`: Links descriptions to elements
- `aria-expanded`: Indicates expandable state
- `aria-pressed`: Indicates toggle button state
- `aria-current`: Indicates current page/item
- `aria-live`: Announces dynamic content
- `aria-busy`: Indicates loading state
- `role="slider"`: For progress/volume bars
- `role="dialog"`: For modals
- `aria-modal`: For modal dialogs

## Visual Accessibility

### Color Contrast

All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements:
- Primary text on dark backgrounds: #FFFFFF on #0B1C2D
- Primary text on light backgrounds: #1E293B on #FFFFFF
- Accent colors maintain 4.5:1 ratio

### Reduced Motion

Users who prefer reduced motion will have:
- All animations disabled
- Transitions set to instant
- Scroll behavior set to auto

This is controlled via CSS `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`.

### High Contrast Mode

The app supports `prefers-contrast: more` media query for users who need higher contrast.

### Text Resizing

- Text scales up to 200% without horizontal scrolling
- No text truncation or overlap at larger sizes
- Units use relative values (rem, em) where appropriate

## Forms

### Labels

- All form fields have associated `<label>` elements
- Labels are visible and positioned close to their fields
- Required fields are marked with visual and programmatic indicators

### Error Messages

- Error messages are associated with fields via `aria-describedby`
- Errors are announced to screen readers
- Inline validation provides immediate feedback

## Media

### Images

- All meaningful images have descriptive `alt` text
- Decorative images use `alt=""` or `aria-hidden="true"`
- Album art includes artist and track information

### Audio Player

- Custom controls are fully keyboard accessible
- Progress and volume sliders use `role="slider"` with appropriate ARIA attributes
- State changes (play/pause) are announced

## Testing

### Automated Testing

The following tools are integrated:

1. **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y**: Linting rules for accessibility
2. **@axe-core/react**: Runtime accessibility testing

### Manual Testing

Test with:
- Screen readers: NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), JAWS
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Browser zoom at 100%, 150%, 200%
- High contrast mode

### Running Accessibility Tests

```bash
# Run ESLint with a11y rules
npm run lint

# axe-core runs automatically in development mode
npm run dev
```

## Components

### Button (`components/common/Button.tsx`)

- Native `<button>` element
- Visible focus indicators
- Loading state with `aria-busy`
- Disabled state communicated to assistive tech

### Modal (`components/common/Modal.tsx`)

- Focus trap implementation
- Escape key closes modal
- Focus restoration on close
- Proper `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal`
- Backdrop click closes modal

### MusicPlayer (`components/player/MusicPlayer.tsx`)

- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Accessible sliders for progress and volume
- ARIA labels for all controls

### Accessibility Utilities (`utils/accessibility.ts`)

Utility functions for:
- Focus management
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus trapping
- Reduced motion detection
- Time/number formatting for screen readers

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Always test with keyboard**: Navigate using Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys
2. **Use semantic HTML**: Prefer native elements over custom implementations
3. **Provide text alternatives**: All non-text content needs alternatives
4. **Don't rely on color alone**: Use icons, text, or patterns in addition to color
5. **Test with screen readers**: Regular testing with actual assistive technology
6. **Run automated tests**: Fix all a11y linting errors before committing
7. **Document accessibility features**: Update this doc when adding new features
